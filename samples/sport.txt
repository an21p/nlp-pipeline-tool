With about 60 red cards handed out every season (380 matches), the average footballer should receive a red card every 132 matches.
But as we shall see, it is a handful of players who do all the damage.  
10. Alan Smith
Red Cards: 6
Appearances: 285
Red Card Rate: 1/48 (1 red card every 48 appearances)
If Alan Smith still played in the Premier League, he'd be sent off in every game. Smith consistently threw himself into reckless challenges with little regard for the damage he caused. He was a fairly gifted forward who played for Leeds, Manchester United, and Newcastle in his career, although Alex Ferguson deployed him as a midfield destroyer during his time in Manchester.
9. Joey Barton
Red Cards: 6
Appearances: 255
Red Card Rate: 1/43

8. Patrick Vieira
Red Cards: 8
Appearances: 307
Red Card Rate: 1/38
Patrick Vieira was a midfield enforcer for Arsenal between 1996 and 2005. He returned for Manchester City in the 2010-11 season. Vieira's size and willingness to get stuck into the tackle resulted in him being sent off 8 times. He also had numerous spats with Roy Keane (see video).
7. Nemanja Vidic
Red Cards: 6
Appearances: 211
Red Card Rate: 1/35
Nemanja Vidic was one of the best defenders in the world during his time at Manchester United. Now that he's nearing retirement, he's finding the pace of the game a little too much to bear. His attempts to win the ball back from quicker players are increasingly resulting in desperate lunges and rash challenges (see video). Two of his six red cards came in the 2013-14 Premier League season; Vidic's last as a Manchester United player.

6. Lee Cattermole
Red Cards: 7
Appearances: 237
Red Card Rate: 1/34
Lee Cattermole is the master of dirty challenges. With 7 red cards by the age of 27, he stands to become the most red carded player in history (the shared record is 8). Remarkably, 6 of his red cards came in the space of 99 appearances for Sunderland. He even received a red card after the final whistle of a match in 2012 for confronting a referee.
5. Duncan Ferguson
Red Cards: 8
Appearances: 269
Red Card Rate: 1/34
Much like Joey Barton, Duncan Ferguson was a true thug. He terrorized defenders between 1994 and 2006. Many of his fouls came from dangerous tackles or off-the-ball incidents. In the video he can be seen headbutting another player.
4. Franck Queudrue
Red Cards: 6
Appearances: 201
Red Card Rate: 1/34
Franck Queudrue's Premier League career lasted from 2001 to 2010, playing for Middlesborough, Fulham, and Birmingham. During the 2002-2003 season he received 3 red cards for reckless challenges. On a lighter note, he scored one of the best own goals ever during his time in the French League (see video).
3. Vinnie Jones
Red Cards: 6
Appearances: 184
Red Card Rate: 1/31
Vinnie Jones's Premier League career lasted from 1992-1998. Before the Premier League emerged, he had already been sent off 6 times, bringing his career total to 12. He holds the record for the quickest ever yellow card, at 3 seconds. After retiring from football, Vinnie brought his hard-man persona to the silver screen.
2. Younes Kaboul
Red Cards: 6
Appearances: 155
Red Card Rate: 1/26
Younès Kaboul is a French central defender who currently plays for Sunderland. He previously played for Portsmouth and Tottenham Hotspur. One of Kaboul's red cards came from a headbutt in 2010. Another came from getting a second yellow card after removing his shirt during a goal celebration. After moving to Sunderland, he received his first red card for the Black Cats after only 5 games.

1. John Hartson
Red Cards: 6
Appearances: 155
Red Card Rate: 1/26
Hartson
Off the field, he was given a conditional discharge for breaking a basket outside of a pub. Most shocking of all, he kicked a team-mate in the face during a training session (see video). For this incident he was fined 20 thousand pounds and banned for 3 matches. He has also had bust-ups with managers Bruce Rioch and Bobby Gould. Despite all this, his reputation appears to be largely undamaged, and he regularly appears as a TV pundit.
Notable Red Card Recipients
An obvious omission from this list is Roy Keane. However, Keane's 7 red cards were received in 366 appearances, giving him a red card rate of 1/52. Other notable absentees are Martin Keown (1/54), Dennis Wise (1/56), and Lee Bowyer (1/79). Richard Dunne's record 8 red cards were received in 397 appearances (1/50), and Steven Gerrard's 6 red cards came in 507 appearances (1/85).
As well as Lee Cattermole, Joey Barton, and Younès Kaboul, there are some other players moving swiftly up the red card rankings. One familiar name is Mario Balotelli, who has 3 red cards in 70 appearances (1/23). With three more red cards, Balotelli will undoubtedly enter this list at number one.
It's worth naming and shaming the players who ruin our enjoyment of the beautiful game. So thanks for reading and watching this stats and video compilation!

Balotelli is far more talented than all these players. And some of his reds are for his youthful exuberance. He is still a kid. If you use an age gap then Balotelli isn't in the list.
But, it must be said, there was a time, football was a little rougher. A lot of yellows and red cards today wouldn't have been given when most of these players started on their path. The Premier league era has changed the money and the officiating of the game to be more softer, toward skills and not letting strong players rough up others.
It is a cultural change as well. Also,

Thanks for commenting Richard. I agree that Balotelli is more of an immature dummy than a malicious thug. However, when he was sent off against Arsenal, he made enough horrendous tackles to be sent off twice. His high foot on Song could have broken the guy's leg easily. I can't remember his other reds so clearly, but the Arsenal match told me that Balotelli could quite easily end a player's career.
Yea, imagine Vinnie Jones in today's matches. He's be sent off every game! It's better that it's softer. For one, it means we can compete in Europe without our players being sent off all the time. Although, having said that, players like Quedrue and Leboeuf found it difficult in England because their tackles were seen as red card offenses, so I'm not sure it's so simple. Perhaps there was some subtle racism from refs in the 90's.

The Arsenal match was particular to Balotelli. He never was as incensed.
Vinnie Jones would have went straight to acting today:)
Well, look at Sergio Ramos and Pepe. Hard defenders, find it tough everywhere today, regardless. I think this is why Ashley Cole is so great a defender, he is a hard defender but tends to do it with skill most of the time.

To be fair, at least the cards totals for each of the last seasons has been consistent, actually i dunno if that is a good or a bad thing, makes me wonder now whether its like the conspiracy that Driving test instructors have to pass and fail a certain quota of people a day/week orso.
Keane and Vierra played unmistakably important roles, their brutality on the pitch allowed the others to play gracefull Football. I think to be fair a lot of these players sure, they arent as technically gifted as Mario but they have a better understanding of the game and in a lot of instance, they picked up their cards, performing their function on the pitch rather than petty petulance like Balotelli

Richard, if Balotelli can do that against Arsenal, he can do it against others. I've seen him make horrendous tackles in other games for sure. I can't remember the specific instances though.
That's why Ashley Cole is so good. Winning the ball skillfully rather than going to ground is what the best Spanish players do. It's what makes Mikel Arteta such a great defensive midfielder for Arsenal. He has the best stats for that position in the league (last I checked).
I guess you could say players like Lebouef came to England because they thought they could get away with more. Or maybe they were bought for their toughness. Pepe and Ramos would have probably come to England back then.

Thanks for the comments FIAB and CCahill.
FIAB, Pepe would probably be top, but I don't follow La Liga as closely. I doubt I could give any more than the stats for those players, if those can even be found.
CCahill, I had the same thought about the total red card numbers. I would have thought that with Cattermole and Barton kicking the league to pieces we might have had more reds, yet it was almost exactly the same.
You're right about the "DM" role back then. Every team had their enforcer, so they were bound to get more cards. Nowadays it's a bit more of a collective effort.

Yeah i thought it'd increase simply cos a lot more offenses are considered a Red card now compared to before.
True, i'd still prefer an absolute out and out dirty bastard on the pitch, to put fear into the opposition ;)

I'm a Sunderland fan and its no surprise to see Cattermole in there!! Although I do like having him in the team as he gets the best out of our other players, great commitment!

Yea, as an Arsenal fan I can see your point. I wish we had a proper combative midfielder to break up the opposition play and captain the team properly. Still, I wouldn't want Cattermole at my club. Someone more in the Makelele or Essien mould please!

I love watching arsenal play but a powerful modfielder is something you miss. Diaby has shown he has the potential to fill that role but hes far too injury prone

Interesting read! Those red cards surely make the game exciting (when the OTHER team gets them...) :)

Thanks for commenting and sharing Kathleen! Also, thanks to tastiger and adam! I used a couple of stat sites to do the research, but as far as I can tell, the red card rate is a unique interpretation. It certainly took a while to input the necessary stats to calculate it.

How come Richard Dunne is not on the list? I believe he has 8 Premier red cards.

It's red card rate :) Dunne has played a lot more games, so 8 red cards doesn't look like a lot when considering that.

Updated after Joey Barton's ridiculous red card. Still at #10 for red card rate on the all time list though. He's quite consistent in his games/dismissals ratio. Expect another one in 43 games!

Updated to include Younes Kaboul at #2 (wow) and to increase the minimum red cards to be on the list to 6. This means Alan Smith makes it in, while Frank Leboeuf and Nikos Dabizas get away with their terrible crimes (5 reds)!
