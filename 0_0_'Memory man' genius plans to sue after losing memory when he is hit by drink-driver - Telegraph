 The machine operator, who took his sister's Zafira car without permission, drove at high speed through Blackpool and Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, before losing control of the vehicle. 
 The machine operator, who took his sister's Zafira car without permission, drove at high speed through Blackpool and Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, before losing control of the vehicle. 
 His car hit the taxi that 51-year-old Mr Morton drives at night. Greenhalgh then hit three more cars before embedding the Zafira in a garden wall. 
 Mr Morton has made numerous TV appearances to show off the skills that could see him remember the contents of telephone books and the sequence of packs of cards. 
never-ending decimal process known as Pi
UK average of about 100
 He said: "My memory is my living. If I can't remember, I face loss of earnings so I am taking legal advice with a view to suing the drunk driver. 
 "It is very frustrating I was in the middle of remembering the names and phone numbers of 3,000 hotels in the UK so I can act as a human travel guide." 
 Greenhalgh, of Lytham, admitted drink-driving and the aggravated taking of his sister's car. 
 He was banned from the road for 14 months, given a six-week curfew and placed on a 12-month community order during which he must undergo 20 days of rehabilitation. 
 Blackpool magistrates also ordered him to pay £210 in court costs. 
 After the hearing, Mr Watson said: "I thought he was going to be charged with dangerous driving. My onboard camera caught him driving straight at me on the wrong side of the road."
