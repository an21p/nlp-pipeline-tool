The by-election - the first of this Parliament - was also the first major electoral test for Mr Corbyn, who was overwhelmingly elected by Labour members in September but has since faced criticism from some of his MPs - which culminated in a major rebellion over Syria on Wednesday.
Appearing at a rally in the constituency to congratulate Mr McMahon, Mr Corbyn said the victory showed how "strong, deep-rooted and broad" the support was for Labour "not just in Oldham but across the country".
Labour, he said, was "driving the Tories back" and challenging "their austerity agenda and narrative".
'Sour grapes'
Labour's Deputy Leader Tom Watson told the BBC that the result was "very, very good" for Mr Corbyn and urged MPs to "swing behind" their leader after what he said was a "difficult week" for the party.
Mr Watson dismissed UKIP's claims about electoral fraud, saying they sounded like "sour grapes" and if their opponents had an evidence of wrongdoing, they should pass them onto the police.
He said they had seen some boxes where 99% of the votes were for Labour, suggesting some members of the Asian population had voted for Labour even though they did not speak English and "did not know who Jeremy Corbyn is".
"It means effectively - in some of these seats where people don't speak English, but they're signed up to postal votes - effectively the electoral process is now dead."
'Staggering result'
UKIP, which has been targeting Labour's vote in its northern strongholds, had hoped to make the by-election a close-fought contest.
But the outcome was clear early in the evening and Labour activists cheered their candidate when he arrived at Oldham's Queen Elizabeth Hall for the count.
Mr McMahon, 35, is the leader of Oldham Council and Labour's most senior representative in the Local Government Association. Mr McMahon, who is regarded as being a centrist within the Labour Party, told reporters it was a "staggering" result for his party.
He added: "I am sick to death of what the Tories are doing to towns like Oldham. The Northern Powerhouse rhetoric is nothing more than a write-off of the north to create a poorhouse."
The Conservatives came third in the by-election, with their vote share down by almost 10%.
election shows its strength and the appeal of its anti-austerity message.
Visiting the constituency, Labour's leader hailed an "incredible" result.
His candidate Jim McMahon secured a 10,722-vote majority over UKIP's John Bickley, and a 62% vote share that was higher than at the general election.
UKIP leader Nigel Farage is to make a formal complaint about the vote, claiming there was electoral fraud.
People were turning up with "bundles of postal votes", he told the BBC.

The by-election was triggered by the death of long-serving Labour MP Michael Meacher, who won the seat at May's general election with a 14,738 majority. Mr McMahon said he had "delivered a result that Michael would be proud of".
'People's trust'
Labour's total majority was lower this time around but the party ended up with a higher vote share as the turnout - just over 40% - was lower than at May's poll.
The expenses watchdog has been accused of a "cover up" after refusing to name two MPs who were re-elected in May while they were subject to secret police investigations.
Ipsa revealed yesterday that it referred the MPs to Scotland Yard in March over their expenses after being given "reason to suspect a criminal offence may have been committed".
However it "buried" the disclosure on page 74 of its annual report and refused to name the two MPs amid concerns that doing so would be "unfair".
The accounts also revealed that the expenses watchdog named just one MP out of the 40 cases it investigated last year.
Sir Alistair Graham,the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said: "Clearly the electorate have a right to know about their member of parliament, especially during an election when there should be total transparency about their track record.
"It was a serious misjudgment by Ipsa not to make public the fact that they had referred the matter to the police.
"You can understand these MPs may feel it would put them at a disadvantage, but presumably at that point Ipsa must have had sufficient evidence to them to think there was a prima face case for an investigation.
"It could give the perception of a cover up prior to a general election. It is bizarre that they are burying in their annual report a very serious piece of information. It has the feel of a cover up."
Peter Davis, Ipsa's compliance officer and a former police superintendent, referred the expenses claims of three MPs to police in March of this year.
In one of the cases police concluded that the MP had no case to answer but gave a 33-year-old female aide a caution for fraud by false representation. Neither the MP or the aide have been named by police or Ipsa.
The two other cases are still being investigated by Scotland Yard's Special Inquiry team, which handles high-profile inquiries.
Mr Davies said in the annual report: “During the course of the reporting period I have felt it necessary for the first time during my term of office to refer requests for investigation received from IPSA to the police.
“Three cases have been forwarded to the Metropolitan Police for assessment. One has been finalised and two remain with the police.”
He assessed 40 cases but only mounted a formal investigation into Bob Blackman, a Conservative MP who was ordered to pay back £1,000 in expenses after claiming more than twice the distance for car journeys.
Other cases were either found to be unfounded or "resolved proportionately" by giving guidance to MPs on how to use the expenses system and interpret the rules. None of the MPs involved were named and details of the complaints have not been published.
In the annual report Mr Davis defended his approach to publicity, stressing that he would do as required and no more.
He said: "I am cognisant that publicity, especially in cases without foundation, carries an inherent risk of reputational damage."
He said the procedures governing his role set out the "information I am required to publish with respect to an investigation, and when this should take place", adding "I will not deviate from this."
In evidence to the Standards Committee in October last year, Mr Davis indicated that he would like even less transparency, saying: "I can see that the vast majority of cases can be dealt with quite effectively without the need for any publicity."
Martin Bell, a former independent MP who has campaigned for greater transparency, said: "The public and above all their constituents have a right to know. There is no case whatsoever for their names not to be revealed.
"The reputation of Parliament is at risk. It has been seriously damaged by the expenses scandal and we would like to think we are making a clean start, which we are obviously not."
In May the Ipsa passed on complaints to the police against George Galloway, the Respect MP for Bradford West between 2012 and 2015.
Mr Galloway, who is now running for Mayor of London, is alleged to have misused parliamentary funds as an MP by reportedly asking his assistant to buy underwear, sort his laundry and plan his wedding.
Ipsa was set up after the Telegraph disclosed the expenses scandal in 2009. The independent body introduced tighter rules, including banning MPs from being able to make mortgage claims for a second home.
After five years of failed attempts, U.S. Senate Republicans on Thursday passed a symbolic partisan bill to gut President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform law, but the effort has already been condemned to death by Obama's plans to veto it.

The Republican-controlled Senate voted 52-47 to repeal several core Obamacare provisions under special budget procedural rules that allow for passage with a simple majority.

Two moderate Republican senators, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Susan Collins of Maine, joined 44 Democrats and one independent in opposing the measure. Independent Senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, did not vote.

Democrats in the Senate have blocked some 61 previous Republican attempts aimed at rolling back the landmark 2010 legislation designed to provide health care for millions of uninsured Americans.People speak with an insurance agent as they discuss plans of the Affordable Care Act at a store setup in the Mall of the Americas in Miami.

Democrats in the Senate have blocked some 61 previous Republican attempts aimed at rolling back the landmark 2010 legislation designed to provide health care for millions of uninsured Americans.


The bill seeks to phase out a major expansion of Medicaid healthcare benefits for the poor under the law and eliminate health insurance subsidies and taxes on medical devices and high-cost plans offered by employers.

It also seeks to deny funding to women's healthcare provider Planned Parenthood, which Republicans have been trying to punish for months over accusations that it illegally sold tissue from aborted fetuses. The group denies the allegations.

The vote gives Republicans their first real chance of putting an Obamacare repeal bill onto the president's desk, which would allow them to make campaign claims that they finally passed legislation to kill the program.

Senate Budget Committee Chairman John Enzi said in debate that Obamacare was "unworkable, unaffordable and more unpopular than ever. For millions of Americans the law today represents nothing more than broken promises, higher costs and fewer choices."

Republicans lack the two-thirds majority needed to override the promised veto by Obama.

The legislation still needs a vote in the House of Representatives, as it differs from a House version passed in October that concentrated on repealing the law's mandates for individuals to buy health insurance and for larger companies to offer health plans to employees.

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, asked if the chamber would simply take up the Senate bill, said: "Why wouldn't we?"

The vote comes at a time when some plans sold via Obamacare insurance exchanges have been struggling with weak enrollment, higher-than-expected medical costs and increased premiums.

The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly approved a five-year highway bill on Thursday that would fund America's roads, bridges and mass-transit systems and revive the charter of the U.S. Export-Import Bank over the objections of conservative Republicans.

In an action that sends the measure to President Barack Obama for his signature, the senators voted 83 to 16 to approve the $305 billion legislation hours after the bill cleared the House of Representatives by a margin of 359 to 65.

Obama is expected to sign the bill into law on Friday, hours before current funding is scheduled to run out.

As the first long-term U.S. highway bill in a decade, the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, or FAST Act, represents a rare victory for bipartisanship in Congress.

"It proves to the American people that we can get things done," said House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster, a Pennsylvania Republican.
The legislation returns the EXIM Bank to operation over conservative opposition that allowed its charter to expire on June 30. The agency, which helps U.S. companies with foreign competitors, would have its charter renewed through Sept. 30, 2019, but with a lower lending limit and other reforms.

Boeing, EXIM's biggest beneficiary, and General Electric have warned that the loss of agency support could cause them to move manufacturing jobs out of the United States. Ethiopian Airlines also expressed concern in September about its ability to take delivery on Boeing jets without EXIM support.

The new act drew accolades from Republicans for providing $280 billion in funding for infrastructure projects from the Highway Trust Fund without increasing the federal gasoline tax.

Democrats cautioned that the modest spending increases would not be enough to fully address the nation's crumbling roads, bridges and rail systems.

To avoid higher taxes, the bill's authors opted for a series of controversial measures including a transfer from the Federal Reserve's surplus funds, an increase in customs fees and a requirement for the Internal Revenue Service to use private tax collection agencies.

The measures would leave the Highway Trust Fund with $10 billion at the end of 2020, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
A number of add-on provisions in the legislation were the subject of intensive lobbying by the transportation industry and safety advocates.
